> Stake Crypto, Earn Interest and Win Prizes

## 3 Line Summary
- Moonpot is for sharing interests(in a way of lottery) from staking assets.
- 50% of interest is a fee to joining a lottery (So no real loss to your base capital).
- More you put into the pot, more likely you get the prize.

## Who are making this?
- Guys from [beefy.finance](beefy.finance) made this service as their new service.

## Will I use this service?
- 2 out of 5
- It is plausible that one can win the lottery even if the input is small, but let's face it.
The odds are too small and giving 50% interest away from staking is permanat loss.
The way I see it, the whole purpose of this is to get more funds in beefy vault without giving any other benefits to users.
